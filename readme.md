## Purpose

These are fun little (non-IF) based things I'm making just to see if I can (and to practice coding). It's probably nothing you haven't seen before! But feel free to download/modify/use/etc.

### tictactoe.py

Tic-tac-toe in the terminal. The goal is to update it after each week of my Intro to Scripting class to reflect the things I've learned (or, the things that I feel confident enough in teaching/figuring out myself).


### amiraizer.py

Command line script to take a text file and convert it into the reality-resistant shorthand of one of my characters (so I don't have to do it myself!). In/out is printed in the terminal, but output is also appened to the file. The only non-alphanumeric char that's converted is "-" while others (including whitespace) are left as is (intentional).
